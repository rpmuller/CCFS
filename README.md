# Computational Chemistry From Scratch

Chemistry studies how the chemical bond formed between atoms determines a variety of properties of molecules and materials, from their shapes to their chemical reactivity. Computational chemistry allows us to predict these properties and design these properties using computers. [Computational Chemistry From Scratch]() attempts to run through the basics of computational chemistry in an easy to understand format, so that students can master the basics completely in a way that will serve as a foundation for deeper investigations.

The student or researcher interested in learning computational chemistry has a large number of excellent free, open, or otherwise easily accessible software tools to choose between, and no longer has to write software herself. However, that often means that she no longer understands the algorithms used and how they are implemented. *Computational Chemistry From Scratch* attempts to solve this by walking the student through computational chemistry algorithms and their implementation so that the student can understand every branch of the algorithm and every line of the code.

The book is divided into several sections. The book will use a subset of the Python programming language and demonstrate how one can build simple versions of sophisticated quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, molecular graphics, and other useful applications in computational chemistry, materials science, condensed matter physics, and other field. It also strives to use few or no external libraries other than the Numpy numeric extensions. In using only this limited subset Python, my hope is that these programs can be easily translated to C, Fortran, Scheme, Julia, or any other language that the student prefers.

The book is also written in a literate programming style that will make all source code generated available to the user in modules.

A very basic introduction to the Python programming language and a justification for the subset of the language that the book uses.
